<h1>CiM2Scheduler</h1>

<h2>An editor tool for easier timetable planning in "Cities in Motion 2"</h2>


<p>view and edit timetables for individual stations</p>


<p>Note that this is NOT a mod and provides no game integration (yet). You will have to transfer timetables, lines and stations manually to, and from the game.
It is meant as a compromise since CiM2 doen't support mod development yet. The best way to use this tool is by running it on a second desktop or a mobile device like a laptop.</p>
