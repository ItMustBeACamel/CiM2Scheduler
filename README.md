<h2>An editor tool for more easy timetable creation in the game "Cities in Motion 2"</h2>


<p>This little program lets you create timetables for lines and stations to ease the process of custom timetable creation and synchronization in Cities in Motion 2</p>


<p>Note that this is NOT a mod and provides no game integration (yet). You will have to transfer timetables, lines and stations manually to, and from the game.</p>
